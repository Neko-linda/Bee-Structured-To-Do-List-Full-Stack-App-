# Bee-Structured-To-Do-List-Full-Stack-App-
A To-Do list application for everyday use. This is a project for GA.
In this project I would like to build an app that assists people in keeping track of whatever tasks they need to do or complete, and have them in one place so that they can divide tasks one by one to make them seem less intimidating to do, and easier to keep track of. My app will use all 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.

User Stories
User stories detailing app functionality
As a user, I want to be able to create new tasks so that I acknowledge what needs to be done.
As a user, I want to be able to delete tasks at my own will if they are already completed or If I change my mind.
As a user, I want to be able to "Complete" my tasks to keep track of what I already completed, and what needs to be done.
As a user, I want to be able to see that I interacted with a button or another part of the website to know that the computer acknowledged my selection.

MVP Goals
A working application using Node.js, Mongoose, Express, and EJS.
The application will utilize the 7 RESTful routes and full CRUD.
Have a dedicated section for the "To-Do" list aspect where the user can delete or "Complete" Tasks.
Have a simple navigation bar with the name of my application and a "Sign in/Sign up" or "Sign out" feature.
Have a container or a bar where the user can type in the name of a task they'd like to add to the list that will add another task to the list already present.

Stretch Goals
I'd like to add a "Description" feature to the tasks so that the user can elaborate on what the task is meant to accomplish.
I'd like to add an "Edit" feature for the user to edit any tasks that have mistakes (Such as spelling errors, accidental add, etc) so that instead of deleting and making a new task, they can edit one that is already established.
I'd like to add "Categories". Tasks can be separated on different pages in different categories. (For example "Do The Dishes" Goes into the "Chores" category, and "Buy Broccoli" Goes into the "Groceries" category)
